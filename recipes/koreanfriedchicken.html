            <ol>
                <li>
                    Stir chicken, onion, garlic, fine salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl until chicken is 
                    coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C).
                </li>    
                <li>
                    Whisk cornstarch, flour, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl. 
                    Gradually whisk ice water into flour in until mixture resembles a smooth pancake batter. 
                    Transfer chicken to batter and stir to coat chicken completely.
                </li>   
                    
                <li>
                    Working in batches, cook chicken in preheated oil for 4 minutes. 
                    Transfer cooked chicken to a cooling rack.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Increase oil temperature in the deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                </li>   
                <li>
                    Working in batches, cook chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy on the outside,
                    3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.
